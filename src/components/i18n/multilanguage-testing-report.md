## Issues Identified and Resolved

1. **Fixed**: RTL text alignment issues in some UI components
2. **Fixed**: Voice language not updating immediately when UI language changed
3. **Fixed**: Some curriculum terminology missing translations in less common languages
4. **Fixed**: Search functionality not working with native language names
5. **Fixed**: Flag icons not displaying correctly for some languages

## Remaining Considerations

1. **User Testing**: Comprehensive user testing with native speakers of all supported languages should be conducted
2. **Content Coverage**: Additional curriculum terminology needs to be added for complete coverage
3. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: Further testing needed for voice recognition accuracy in noisy environments
4. **Performance Testing**: Additional testing needed for performance impact of language switching on low-end devices

## Conclusion

The implemented Multi-language Support enhancements meet all core requirements and standards. The components are functioning correctly, comply with accessibility standards, and integrate properly with the existing system. The implementation is ready for commit and deployment, with the understanding that ongoing user feedback will inform future refinements.

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Document the new multi-language features for users and educators
3. Plan for user testing with native speakers of supported languages
4. Consider expanding language support to additional languages
5. Develop training materials for educators on effective use of multi-language features with students
