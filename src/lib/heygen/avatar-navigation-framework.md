# AI Avatar Navigation Framework for EdPsych AI Education Platform

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive strategy for implementing AI avatar videos throughout the EdPsych AI Education Platform. It defines when and where avatar videos should appear, how they integrate with the user journey, and how they adapt to different user roles and subscription tiers.

## Core Principles

1. **Contextual Relevance**: Avatar videos appear at moments of highest value in the user journey
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is provided when needed, not all at once
3. **Consistent Presence**: Avatars establish a persistent but non-intrusive presence
4. **Role-Based Guidance**: Different avatars serve different user roles and contexts
5. **Cost Management**: Implementation respects resource constraints, especially for free tier users
6. **Emotional Intelligence**: Videos convey appropriate emotional tone for each context

   - First login/onboarding
   - First visit to main sections (dashboard, curriculum, progress)
   - Error recovery and basic help
3. **Standard Quality**: Videos use standard quality settings
4. **No Personalization**: Videos contain generic guidance without user-specific elements
5. **Text Alternatives**: All videos have text alternatives available

### Standard Tier Implementation

Standard tier users receive enhanced avatar video experiences:

1. **Expanded Touchpoints**: Videos at all core navigation points plus:
   - Feature-specific guidance
   - Contextual help throughout the platform
   - Inactivity detection and engagement
2. **Limited Personalization**: Some videos include basic personalization elements:
   - User name
   - Recent activity references
   - Learning preferences
3. **Higher Quality**: Videos use high quality settings
4. **Credit System**: 20 credits monthly for custom video generation

### Premium Tier Implementation

Premium tier users receive the full avatar video experience:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Videos available at all defined touchpoints
2. **Full Personalization**: Videos include advanced personalization:
