              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is Emotional Regulation?</h3>
              <p>
                Emotional regulation refers to the ability to effectively manage and respond to emotional experiences. 
                It involves recognising emotions, understanding their intensity and impact, and developing strategies 
                to manage them appropriately. This skill is crucial for academic success, social relationships, and 
                overall wellbeing.

              <p>
                Our emotional regulation support tools are grounded in research from educational psychology, 
                neuroscience, and therapeutic approaches. We've integrated evidence-based practices from:

                  <h4 className="font-semibold">Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h4>
                  <p>
                    CBT approaches to emotional regulation focus on the connection between thoughts, feelings, 
                    and behaviours. Our tools incorporate cognitive restructuring and behavioural strategies 
                    recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

                  <p>
                    We've adapted key emotional regulation skills from DBT, which has strong evidence for 
                    supporting emotional regulation. These include mindfulness practices, distress tolerance, 
                    and emotional awareness techniques.

                  <p>
                    Our approach is influenced by the Zones of Regulation framework, a systematic, cognitive-behavioural 
                    approach used to teach self-regulation by categorizing emotions into four coloured zones.

                  <p>
                    Our body awareness components are informed by Polyvagal Theory, which explains the connection 
                    between the autonomic nervous system and emotional states, helping students understand 
                    physiological responses to emotions.

                    Our approach aligns with recommendations from the British Psychological Society and 
                    educational psychology research specific to UK educational contexts.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
                <li>
                  Research by the Education Endowment Foundation shows that social and emotional learning 
                  interventions have an identifiable and valuable impact on attitudes to learning and social 
                  relationships in school.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Studies published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology demonstrate that 
                  emotional regulation skills are strongly correlated with academic achievement and classroom behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Research from University College London indicates that explicit teaching of emotional 
                  vocabulary and regulation strategies can significantly improve students' ability to manage 
                  challenging emotions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A meta-analysis in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that emotional 
                  regulation interventions show moderate to large effects for children with neurodevelopmental 
                  conditions.
