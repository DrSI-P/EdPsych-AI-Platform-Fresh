                  EdPsych Connect was born from Dr. Scott I-Patrick's doctoral research on school connectedness and his extensive experience working with children and young people across diverse educational settings. After witnessing firsthand the challenges faced by students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, he envisioned a platform that could democratize access to high-quality, personalized education.

                <Typography variant="body" className="mb-4">
                  Drawing on principles of educational psychology, restorative practices, and relationship-building, Dr. I-Patrick assembled a team of dedicated educators, psychologists, and technologists to create a platform that addresses the root causes of educational challenges rather than just their symptoms.
