## Conclusion

The deployment of the EdPsych AI Platform to production using Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the database infrastructure was completed successfully within the scheduled maintenance window. The deployment followed the planned process, including database migration, frontend deployment, and canary release.

All verification tests passed, and the platform is now fully operational in production. The 24-hour intensive monitoring has been set up to ensure any issues are detected and addressed promptly.

The platform is now available to users with all features functioning as expected. The deployment team will continue to monitor the platform and address any issues that may arise.

## Next Steps

1. Continue 24-hour intensive monitoring
2. Collect and analyze user feedback
3. Conduct post-deployment review meeting
4. Document lessons learned
5. Plan for future enhancements
