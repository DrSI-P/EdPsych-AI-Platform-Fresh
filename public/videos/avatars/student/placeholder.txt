This is a placeholder for student peer avatar videos.

In production, this directory would contain MP4 video files with the following naming convention:

Examples:
- student_alex_introduction_welcome.mp4
- student_jamie_instructional_assessment_tools.mp4
- student_alex_emotional_support_dealing_with_stress.mp4
- student_jamie_transition_starting_study_session.mp4
- student_alex_peer_explanation_learning_styles.mp4

These videos would be generated using HeyGen with appropriate student avatar models.
