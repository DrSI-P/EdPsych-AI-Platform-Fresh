Hello, I'm Dr Scott I-Patrick - DEdPsych, BSc, CPsychol, MBPsS - Chartered Child and Adolescent Psychologist and Managing Director of EdPsych Connect Limited.

[Expression shifts to serious, authoritative - leaning forward slightly]
Before I show you what makes our platform truly revolutionary, let me address what I know is your primary concern: security and credibility.

[Leaning in, more personal and passionate]
My doctoral thesis explored restorative justice practices in schools - an evidence-based alternative to exclusionary sanctions that focuses on repairing relationships rather than punishment. This research directly informs our platform's approach to behavior support and social-emotional learning.

[Leaning in, more intimate tone with genuine care]

My research explored how restorative justice practices in schools can improve student connectedness and social relationships, particularly for students who struggle with traditional disciplinary approaches.
