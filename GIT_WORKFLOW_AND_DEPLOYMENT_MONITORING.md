# EdPsych AI Platform - Git Workflow and Deployment Monitoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the Git workflow strategy and deployment monitoring approach for the EdPsych AI Platform. These guidelines ensure consistent, reliable, and traceable development and deployment processes.

## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure

The EdPsych AI Platform repository follows a structured branching strategy:

1. **Main Branch (`main`)**
   - The primary branch representing production-ready code
   - Always deployable to production
   - Protected from direct commits
   - Requires pull request approval for merges

2. **Development Branch (`develop`)**
   - Integration branch for ongoing development
   - Features and fixes are merged here first
   - Deployed to the development environment
   - Periodically merged to `main` for releases

3. **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**
   - Created for new features or enhancements
   - Branched from `develop`
   - Merged back to `develop` via pull request
   - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`

4. **Bug Fix Branches (`fix/*`)**
   - Created for bug fixes
   - Branched from `develop` for non-critical bugs
   - Branched from `main` for critical production bugs
   - Merged to source branch via pull request
   - Naming convention: `fix/bug-description`

5. **Release Branches (`release/*`)**
   - Created when preparing for a release
   - Branched from `develop`
   - Only bug fixes and release preparation commits
   - Merged to both `main` and `develop` when ready
   - Naming convention: `release/vX.Y.Z`

6. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**
   - Created for urgent production fixes
   - Branched from `main`
   - Merged to both `main` and `develop`
   - Naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`

### Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format

All commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **Type**: Describes the kind of change
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

- **Scope**: Optional field specifying the section of the codebase affected
  - Examples: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `db`, `avatar`

- **Subject**: Brief description of the change
  - Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds")
  - Don't capitalize the first letter
  - No period at the end

- **Body**: Optional detailed description of the change
  - Explain motivation for the change
  - Contrast with previous behavior

- **Footer**: Optional, for referencing issues or breaking changes
  - `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123` to auto-close issues
  - `BREAKING CHANGE: description` for breaking changes

#### Examples

```
feat(avatar): add HeyGen API integration for video generation

Implement secure connection to HeyGen API for generating avatar videos.
Add caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce API calls.

Closes #456
```

```
fix(auth): resolve session timeout issue

Users were being logged out prematurely due to incorrect token expiration calculation.
Changed expiration time from 1 hour to 24 hours and fixed the refresh token logic.

Fixes #789
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Creation**
   - Create a pull request from your feature/fix branch to the target branch
   - Use a clear, descriptive title following the commit message format
   - Fill out the PR template with all required information

2. **Description**
   - Provide a detailed description of the changes
   - Reference related issues using keywords (e.g., "Closes #123")
   - Include screenshots or videos for UI changes
   - List any new dependencies introduced

3. **Review Process**
   - Assign at least two reviewers
   - Address all review comments
   - Ensure CI checks pass
   - Update documentation if necessary

4. **Approval and Merging**
   - Require at least two approvals before merging
   - Use squash merging for feature branches to maintain a clean history
   - Use merge commits for release and hotfix branches to preserve history

### Release Process

1. **Release Preparation**
   - Create a release branch from `develop`
   - Update version numbers in relevant files
   - Generate and update changelog
   - Fix any release-specific issues

2. **Release Testing**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct thorough testing
   - Fix any issues found

3. **Release Finalization**
   - Merge release branch to `main` via pull request
   - Merge release branch back to `develop`
   - Create a Git tag with the version number
   - Create a GitHub release with release notes

4. **Post-Release**
   - Monitor production deployment
   - Address any issues with hotfixes if necessary
