## Deployment Procedure

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification

1. **Verify all pre-requisites**:
   - Confirm all tests have passed
   - Confirm all validation has passed
   - Verify database backup is recent and valid
   - Verify rollback procedures are tested
   - Confirm all team members are available

2. **Prepare deployment package**:
   - Create deployment artifact
   - Tag release in version control
   - Upload artifact to secure storage
   - Verify artifact integrity

3. **Final configuration check**:
   - Review environment variables
   - Verify database connection strings
   - Check API keys and credentials
   - Verify SSL certificates

### 2. Database Migration

1. **Backup current database**:
   ```bash
   pg_dump -h edpsych-db.cluster-xyz123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U edpsych_admin -d edpsych_production > edpsych_pre_deploy_backup.sql
   ```

2. **Verify backup integrity**:
   ```bash
   pg_restore --list edpsych_pre_deploy_backup.sql
   ```

3. **Execute migration scripts**:
   ```bash
   node deployment/scripts/run-migrations.js
   ```

4. **Verify migration success**:
   ```bash
   node deployment/scripts/verify-database.js
   ```

### 3. Green Environment Deployment

1. **Deploy to green environment**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/deploy-green.sh
   ```

2. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/verify-deployment.js green
   ```

3. **Run smoke tests**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/run-smoke-tests.js green
   ```

### 4. Canary Release

1. **Start canary release (5%)**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/canary-release.sh green 5
   ```

2. **Monitor health metrics**:
   - Error rate < 1%
   - Response time < 500ms
   - CPU usage < 80%
   - Memory usage < 80%

3. **Gradually increase traffic**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/canary-release.sh green 10
   ./deployment/scripts/canary-release.sh green 25
   ./deployment/scripts/canary-release.sh green 50
   ./deployment/scripts/canary-release.sh green 100
   ```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Verify production functionality**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/verify-production.js
   ```

2. **Monitor system health**:
   - Check error rates
   - Check response times
   - Check resource utilization
   - Check user activity

3. **Send deployment notification**:
   ```bash
   node deployment/scripts/send-deployment-notification.js success
   ```

## Rollback Procedure

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Critical functionality failure
- Security incident

### Rollback Steps

1. **Initiate rollback**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh
   ```

2. **Verify rollback success**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/scripts/verify-deployment.js blue
   ```

3. **Send rollback notification**:
   ```bash
   node deployment/scripts/send-deployment-notification.js rollback
   ```

4. **Document rollback reason**:
   ```bash
   node deployment/scripts/document-rollback.js
   ```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Database migration failure | Medium | High | Prepare and test rollback scripts, have DBA on standby | Database Administrator |
| High error rate during canary | Low | High | Automated monitoring and rollback, gradual traffic increase | DevOps Engineer |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Load testing before deployment, auto-scaling, performance monitoring | DevOps Engineer |
| Security vulnerability | Low | Critical | Pre-deployment security scan, WAF rules, real-time security monitoring | Security Engineer |
| Integration failure with external systems | Medium | High | Pre-deployment integration testing, fallback modes for critical integrations | QA Engineer |
| Team member unavailability | Low | Medium | Cross-training team members, documented procedures, backup personnel | Deployment Lead |
| Infrastructure failure | Low | Critical | Multi-AZ deployment, automated failover, infrastructure redundancy | DevOps Engineer |
| Incomplete data migration | Medium | High | Data validation scripts, data integrity checks | Database Administrator |

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Alert To | Response |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Error Rate | Datadog | > 1% | DevOps, Deployment Lead | Investigate, fix or rollback |
| Response Time | Datadog | > 500ms | DevOps | Scale up, optimize, or rollback |
| CPU Usage | CloudWatch | > 80% | DevOps | Scale up or optimize |
| Memory Usage | CloudWatch | > 80% | DevOps | Scale up or optimize |
| Database Connections | CloudWatch | > 80% | DBA | Optimize queries, connection pooling |
| API Success Rate | Datadog | < 99% | DevOps, Developers | Investigate, fix or rollback |
| User Session Count | Custom | < 90% of normal | Support, Deployment Lead | Investigate user access issues |

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

1. **Technical Criteria**:
   - All services are operational
   - Error rate is below 0.5%
   - Response time is below 200ms
   - All data is migrated correctly
   - All integrations are functioning

2. **Business Criteria**:
   - User adoption of new features > 30% in first week
   - Support ticket volume < 120% of normal
   - No critical bugs reported
   - User satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0

3. **Operational Criteria**:
   - Deployment completed within maintenance window
   - No unplanned rollbacks
   - All monitoring systems functioning
   - Documentation updated

## Conclusion

This deployment execution plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for deploying the EdPsych AI Platform to production. By following this plan, we will ensure a smooth deployment with minimal disruption to users.
